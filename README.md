Beaver Express
==============
An unofficial Google Chrome extension for the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) library. 
Beaver Express (codenamed B.EX) was developed as a proof-of-concept prototype to demonstrate one among many other possible uses of LSE's library API that is currently private. 
The library system's generativity will depend ultimately on the versatility of its API which is currently limited.
